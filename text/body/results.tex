\section{Results and Discussion} \label{sec:results}

We now present the results of the experiements mentioned in the previous section, as well as their significance.

\subsection{Runtime Comparison}

A direct comparison between the naive trie-based and the optimized shortcut table-based approches highlights the massive savings achieved by the new algorithm. As seen in Figure~\ref{fig:comparison}, the original algorithm explodes in runtime, whereas the new algorithm performs so well that there is no clear increase in runtime.

The naive and optimized algorithms were implemented with all things constant except for two details: the optimized algorithm used a search table and included shortcut optimizations. Because a search table is merely a different data structure used for a tree (an alternative to using a node-pointer approach), with equivalent time complexities for all operations, one could expect this change to result in a constant speedup (if any) between the two algorithms.

Because this result is not by a constant factor, we can assume that a majority of the speedup came from the shortcuts saving a significant amount of work that was unncessarily done in the naive approach.
