Generated using a tilted retention policy and a surface of 32 bits. The true phylogeny is on the left and the reconstructed phylogeny is on the right. Colors are based on a hash from the taxon label for each tip to better facilitate visual comparison. Reconstruction error for this reconstruction was 2.6\%.
