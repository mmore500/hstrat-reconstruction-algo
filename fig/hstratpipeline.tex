\textbf{Phylogeny reconstruction pipeline.}
\small
Raw hexidecimal genome strings in ``genomes'' dataframe are segmented to ``unpack'' hstrat marker region.
Next, individual markers are decoded into ``exploded'' format.
Reconstruction progressively extends inferred trie one genome marker sequence at a time, with intermittent unifurcation cleanup to reduce memory usage.
Finally, trie is converted and saved as dataframe in alife data standard format.
Implementation leverages high-performance scientific computing libraries to achieve efficient operation on large datasets.
