\textbf{Execution profile of reconstruction pipeline from macrobenchmark trial.}
\small
Results are shown for 1 billion tip reconstruction trials.
Trials differed in simulation data source, with ``adaptive regime'' genomes sampled under conditions with lower phylogenetic richness.
Other category includes Parquet load and save time as well as latency from marker explosion/decoding, which was asynchronously overlapped with trie extension operations.
